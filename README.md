# tree-sitter grammar for pi-forall

This was a tree-sitter parser for pi-forall that I made a couple of years ago. It was an experiment to learn how to do off-side (indentation sensitive) parsing in tree-sitter. I stopped when I solved that, not finishing the grammar itself. I don't have `data` in there yet.



`tree-sitter generate` generates the parser
`tree-sitter build-wasm` is needed for the playground
`tree-sitter playground` loads a test file
